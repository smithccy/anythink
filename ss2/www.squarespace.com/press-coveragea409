The front entrance deposits you directly into what could be called a cafeteria—although that word’s fluorescent-lit connotations don’t do justice to the space’s elegant wooden tables, giant windows, and taps flowing with kombucha and beer (The beer taps are locked until the evening.) All 150 Squarespace employees can get lunch here (the food’s provided by Cravings, a local caterer), and the two floors above have kitchens with adjoining snack and breakfast pantries so stocked it would make a Costco-crazy parent blush. (On a recent visit, my tour guides were still raving about the previous day’s build-your-own burger lunch, which included vegan and vegetarian options.) If you haven’t caught on yet, food is a big deal here.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">On the second floor, the wonders continue in the “Vault,” a dark theater with a massive 75-inch screen, PS4 and N64 consoles, and a&nbsp;<em>Rock Band</em>&nbsp;rig for gaming—or, you know a quiet place to work, if employees are so inclined. (Employees all have laptops, and while there are sections tied to workgroups, people in general are free to roam.).</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">As you’ve probably seen in its Super Bowl ads starring a motorcycle surfing Keanu Reeves, Squarespace (which also has offices in NYC and Dublin) is a website building platform, often used to create digital craft, photography, writing, and art portfolios. The company gives its employees two free websites to use for their personal projects, encouraging them to pursue their creative pursuits. Employees also make their own “cover pages” which the company displays like huge rotating business cards on screens around the office—they include employees’ preferred pronouns, interests, hobbies, and extracurricular projects.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">All those little things add up. According to Mary Good, Squarespace’s “chief people officer,” the most popular response on a recent employee survey says it all: “I feel like I can be myself here.”</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class=""><a href="https://www.pdxmonthly.com/articles/2019/12/31/squarespace-s-downtown-office-puts-an-emphasis-on-togetherness-and-food">Read more.</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Squarespace gets $2.2M in tax incentives to expand</title><dc:creator>Ahrim Nam</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 20:57:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.squarespace.com/press-coverage/crains-new-york-squarespace-nyc-expansion</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065:5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8086:5e1cd9ccbd93ff01ed8e2fcb</guid><description><![CDATA[Crain’s New York Business]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>One of the city's biggest homegrown success stories to add 156 employees in the next three years</h2><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">Website design platform Squarespace is expanding its downtown Manhattan headquarters, making the company—like Amazon, Google and Facebook—the latest technology firm to grow its presence in the city.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">As part of Squarespace’s expansion, Gov.

She quickly creates a Squarespace website so he can show off what she believes are modern art installations, much to his chagrin.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">“You want to put even more trash on the internet?” he quips.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">By the time the website goes live, it’s all over for Oscar. It’s not long until his old pizza boxes, crumpled up newspapers, wet socks and banana peels are on display at galleries across New York. He’s even dubbed “this generation’s greatest artist,” a proclamation that induces nothing but eye rolls from him.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">All of the attention is maddening for Oscar, but there’s a fun twist at the end when he finally realizes that he’s never been more miserable.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">The campaign is a tie-up with Sesame Street, which is celebrating its 50th birthday this year.

He’s created 25 trash cubes inspired by Sesame Street, all of which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oscartrashart.com/shop" target="_blank">appear to be sold out</a>.

It consists mostly of employees who address customer issues through either live chats or email, but that is changing.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">The company is now hiring engineers for this office. It’s looking for folks in site reliability engineering and server infrastructure, Casalena said.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">The expanded roles are the result of a couple of key engineering leadership hires out of the Portland talent pool.<br><br></p><p class="">“Right now the main headquarters is New York (with) offices in Portland and Dublin, Ireland,” Casalena told the Business Journal. “Now we really think with the right local leaders we can increase the number of disciplines in the offices.”</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">It’s a familiar progression for Portland, which is home to several satellite offices for larger tech companies. Peer-to-peer hospitality site Airbnb, which came to Portland in 2014 as well, had a similar path in Portland. It opened an office that was largely customer care operations but has since expanded the team to roughly 400 and added engineering and product employees.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Squarespace expects to hire a dozen or more engineers as part of its 2020 plans.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Casalena said as the company has become more familiar with the talent pool in Portland, especially for engineers, it made sense to add the roles in the office. Aside from any new roles in the Portland office, the company has nine other roles open in Portland in customer care.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Squarespace has an online software platform that helps customers build their own websites. Earlier this month it acquired the company Unfold, which has templates for people to create Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat stories. It’s the company’s first foray into helping customers create content for social media.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Casalena said Unfold’s customer care support will be absorbed by Squarespace’s existing care teams like the one in Portland.</p><p><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/press-coverage/portland-business-journal-sqsp">Permalink</a><p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What makes a happy work environment?</title><dc:creator>Ahrim Nam</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2019 17:13:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.squarespace.com/press-coverage/creative-review-what-makes-a-happy-environment</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065:5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8086:5c48aee621c67c9156300e6b</guid><description><![CDATA[Creative Review]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Happiness is no longer an afterthought for businesses, but what elements go into creating a positive workplace?
