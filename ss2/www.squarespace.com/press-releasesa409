Cuomo today announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>, the all-in-one website building platform that delivers award-winning design to millions of customers, will expand its global headquarters in New York City, growing its New York presence 20 percent by 2022. The expansion will create over 150 new tech jobs — seventy percent of which will be on Squarespace's engineering team, with the remainder supporting product design, marketing, operations and other roles that will support the company's rapid growth. As part of the expansion, Squarespace will invest in building out two newly-leased floors in the West Village's historic&nbsp;Maltz&nbsp;Building. Today's announcement supports Governor Cuomo's efforts to further develop New York's tech economy and to create jobs in communities across the state.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">"New York State has added tens of thousands of tech jobs over the last decade — and we are not slowing down anytime soon. Thanks to smart state investments in the tech-talent pipeline, we are continuing to grow our economy and generate opportunities for New Yorkers,"&nbsp;Governor Cuomo said.&nbsp;"Squarespace is a prime example of New York's tech-industry strength, and we are proud they are expanding their global headquarters — helping cement our position as a global tech leader."</p><p class=""><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p class="">Squarespace Founder and CEO Anthony&nbsp;Casalena&nbsp;said,&nbsp;"As a tech company that has grown up in New York City over the past decade, I strongly believe the diversity of talent and industry in our great city has offered us unique advantages while inspiring our design-led approach. Our vision at Squarespace is to be the leading brand platform for the next generation of independent businesses and creators, and we're proud to invest in our headquarters to attract new employees who will help our customers around the world succeed in their pursuits."</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">In 2016, Squarespace established its global headquarters in New York City, leasing three floors in the West Village's historic&nbsp;Maltz&nbsp;Building. They have since taken over two additional floors and established a content studio in the building's basement to bring all creative capabilities in-house. In total, Squarespace will now occupy 166,000 square feet over five floors and will invest millions in outfitting its new space.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Empire State Development Acting Commissioner and President &amp; CEO-Designate Eric Gertler said,&nbsp;"Thanks to smart state investments and Governor Cuomo's leadership, tech companies are starting and growing in New York every day, and we are proud to count Squarespace among the leaders of our thriving tech ecosystem. This&nbsp;expansion is a major vote of confidence by one of the Empire State's most successful unicorn companies — as we continue to grow our tech sector with great excitement."</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">To support Squarespace's expansion of its global headquarters in New York City and its creation of at least 156 tech jobs, Empire State Development has offered the company up to $2.2 million in performance-based Excelsior Tax Credits over the next 10 years.&nbsp;Squarespace will only receive the full value of the credits if they create at least 156 jobs by 2022, and then retain those new jobs and more than 700 existing New York City-based jobs through 2029.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Under Governor Cuomo's leadership, New York State has made strategic investments to encourage innovation, entrepreneurship and tech development. Since 2011, New York's tech employment has grown 23 percent, from approximately 327,000 to 403,000 jobs. In New York City, the change has been more dramatic, growing from roughly 114,000 to 180,000 jobs — or an increase of 58 percent.

The spot, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b0W8nuAOqo&amp;feature=youtu.be">“Dream It,”</a> follows Idris’ nostalgic exploration of aspirations from childhood that many can relate to, as he transforms from fashion designer to professional boxer to astronaut.

The in-game commercial features Keanu Reeves, a Squarespace customer and the co-founder of Arch Motorcycle, surfing atop one of his own bikes. While riding the motorcycle, Reeves encourages audiences to take the same metaphorical leap to pursue their passions and follow their dreams. The 30-second spot will run during the big game as part of a larger brand campaign with Reeves, which includes two additional films intended to inspire viewers to take the first step in pursuing their passions by making a website on Squarespace.</p><p>Six years ago, with his co-founder Gard Hollinger and the rest of the Arch team, Reeves launched the American-made motorcycle company inspired by his passion for motorcycles. Arch chose Squarespace to launch their project into the world because of the companies’ shared emphasis on powerful design. Reeves, heavily involved in the creation of his bikes, also takes a hands-on approach managing the Arch Motorcycle website on Squarespace.</p><p>“There’s something about Squarespace that’s really accessible yet sophisticated,” said Reeves. “The design and functionality share a similar ethos to Arch Motorcycle. When I was approached to make this commercial, we were already using the platform, which makes it a really organic fit.”</p><p>Squarespace Founder and CEO Anthony Casalena said, “Squarespace was created to empower individuals to realize their creative and entrepreneurial aspirations. Even in turbulent times, we’ve seen the persistence of the American entrepreneurial spirit, and are proud to have a small hand in making it easier for people to turn their dreams into reality. We hope that Keanu’s authentic Squarespace story inspires others to get out there and make it happen for themselves.”</p><p>As part of the partnership, Squarespace also worked with <a href="https://www.archmotorcycle.com/">Arch Motorcycle</a> to revamp its website, giving Arch an aesthetic upgrade using one of Squarespace’s stock templates, <a href="https://camino-demo.squarespace.com/">Camino</a>.

The old adage goes sex, drugs, and rock ‘n roll, but Americans today are more interested in something else entirely. And with over half of Americans interested in starting their own business, that’s a lot of sacrifice.</p><p>Squarespace partnered with global research firm Kelton to conduct its study, and discovered that 52% of Americans are interested in starting their own business, and that more than one in five of these ambitious folks would like to do so in the next six months.</p><p>Furthermore, 89% of Americans have a personal passion project they’re interested in turning into a career. Why? Perhaps because 96% of Americans have a burning desire to be their own boss. In fact, Americans are so eager to start their own ventures that 55% of them would give up alcohol for a month, whereas 52% would sacrifice sex for a month. 36% of Americans even say they would jump out of a plane in order to bring their ideas to life.</p><p>So why aren’t more Americans embarking upon their entrepreneurial journeys? Squarespace found that the bulk of would-be business owners’ fears are financial, as 61% worry that they won’t turn a profit or will face financial risks. Others, however, simply need a confidence boost, as they’re concerned that their passion projects might fail (55%), see no customers (50%), or that they simply aren’t good enough (36%).</p><p>Squarespace, however, can help Americans (and folks around the world), take the first step in creating a business by creating a beautiful online presence. Thanks to Squarespace’s extensive suite of online tools, which includes a website builder, e-Commerce features, and a domains manager, anyone can bring his or her idea to life online.</p><h3>About Squarespace</h3><p>Squarespace powers the next generation of the independent workforce by providing millions of makers, thinkers, and doers with the tools they need to bring their unique stories to life.

Instead of being built around an ad, our campaign is built around a real project on our platform.”</p><p>The collaboration, “Jeff Bridges Sleeping Tapes”, brought to life on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dreamingwithjeff.com">DreamingWithJeff.com</a>, features a unique album of relaxing sounds, guided meditations, and stories designed to lull you to sleep. Created and recorded by Jeff Bridges, the sleeping tracks are free to stream online as a ‘pay what you like’ release on Jeff’s Squarespace site (<a target="_blank" href="http://dreamingwithjeff.com">DreamingWithJeff.com</a>).</p><p>Limited-run cassette tapes and vinyls will be available for sale on the website following the ad’s debut, and 5 special limited-edition vinyls will be auctioned off separately. 100% of the retail price (excluding shipping and service fees) fro each album sold goes directly to Share Our Strength’s No Kid Hungry® campaign, which is dedicated to ensuring kids have access to the healthy food they need, every day.</p><p>Squarespace will debut its second-ever Super Bowl creative during NBC’s broadcast on Sunday, February 1. The <a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/UHCZebZzGJs">30-second spot</a>, directed by Tim Godsall, will feature Bridges and highlight his Sleeping Tapes project. The never-before-seen ad will be released in the first half of the game. A 30-second teaser, released today, will air in the days leading up to the game and then during the pregame.</p><p>“Making DreamingWithJeff.com has been a great experience. I got the chance to work with friends old and new to make something pretty special,” said Jeff Bridges. “I was able to take the seed of an idea, make it my own, and then see it come to life in such a beautiful way. That's what Squarespace does. I love the work we've done, and I'm proud that it will benefit the No Kid Hungry campaign, a cause I believe in so deeply.”</p><p>A longtime anti-hunger advocate, Mr. Bridges has been national spokesperson for the No Kid Hungry campaign since 2010.</p><p>The campaign was created and produced by global advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy New York.</p><p>“At its core, the campaign is a product demonstration. We used Squarespace's beautiful design and e-commerce capabilities to take an idea that seemed a bit odd, and turn it into something real and meaningful,” remarked David Kolbusz, Executive Creative Director at Wieden+Kennedy New York. “The album is a legitimate Jeff Bridges project, sold on a Squarespace site, with profits going to No Kid Hungry. And best of all, it works. His voice is like oak and leather and cigar smoke and the wilderness. I personally have fallen asleep to the recording on more than one occasion. Hopefully the project will show people that Squarespace can help make anything they dream up become more amazing.”</p><p>After the Super Bowl, the campaign will be expanded nationwide to include TV, digital, and social components.

Squarespace Commerce is available to all existing and new Squarespace users in Canada at $USD 24 per month. The flat price includes all features, imposes no additional commissions, and does not limit SKUs.<br></p><p>“Since launching Squarespace Commerce, we’ve gotten an overwhelming amount of requests to make our new e-commerce features available to Canadian users,” said Anthony Casalena, CEO and Founder of Squarespace. “Canada is our second biggest market, and we’re excited to offer the full range of Squarespace’s features and capabilities in this country.”</p><p>Squarespace’s interface has been updated to accommodate different currencies and measurements. Sellers can choose between Imperial and Metric standards to define product weights and weight-based shipping options. In addition, sellers can define taxes internationally and locally down to the postal code level, and Canadian sellers can list provincial and federal sales taxes separately in order invoices. As before, you can choose to add tax on products as well as shipping. It’s possible to add more fine-grained shipping rules by jurisdiction, and define local rules by a single postal code or a range of postal codes.</p><p>Sellers can easily add store pages to existing websites and present products in a flexible, minimal grid that can be customized using the Squarespace Style Editor. Additionally, sellers can easily feature items for sale anywhere on their site by dragging and dropping a Product Block directly onto blog posts, pages, or sidebars, allowing for a truly editorialized commerce experience.</p><p>Initially designed for small stores with fewer than 200 SKUs, Squarespace Commerce is a powerful commerce offering with over 20 new features. The platform supports multi-dimensional product variants (such as size and color) as well as sale prices. The order fulfillment interface lets sellers easily see outstanding orders, resend customer update emails, and print packing slips. Digital goods are delivered upon purchase via customized email links that expire in 24 hours. Sellers can also create multiple kinds of coupons with different restrictions and expiry dates.</p><p>Squarespace Commerce in Canada is powered by Stripe, an easy way to accept credit cards. Prospective sellers can sign up for Stripe directly within Squarespace and will be able to accept payments immediately using Stripe. Stripe charges a simple and transparent fee of 2.9% + $0.30 per successful transaction, and there are no Squarespace-imposed transaction fees for any customers. All prices are quoted in CAD for Canadian stores on Squarespace.</p><p>For more information and a free 14-day trial, visit Squarespace at www.squarespace.com.</p><h3>About Squarespace</h3><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><p>Squarespace’s mission is to provide creative tools that power the future of the web.
