<p class="">To honor the life-changing impact of looking at an object from a different point of view, we recently partnered with our friends at Sesame Workshop to host an art workshop for children from local nonprofit community agency Hudson Guild. The students created their own works of art using recycled objects, and heard a few inspirational words from Oscar himself as well as from Rosemarie Truglio, Ph.D., Sesame Workshop’s SVP of Curriculum and Content.</p>

With this series, our Squarespace YouTube creators share their own stories and tell you how to get started. It’s time to embrace this next chapter and run with it.</em></p><p class="">As Jessica Whitaker was launching her career as a professional photographer, she recognized that “there wasn’t a place online for young photographers, beginner photographers, hobbyist photographers to come and receive education through a gentle guiding source.” So she created one: <a href="https://buildandbloom.org/"><span>Build+Bloom</span></a> began in 2016 as a Facebook community and quickly became one of the most engaged photography communities on the social network.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Whitaker knew that she needed to expand Build+Bloom in order to support those photographers. “The first thing I knew we needed to do… was create a website that would be a hub for us with all of our information outside of [Facebook].” That website became the digital home of Build+Bloom as Whitaker grew it into a non-profit organization. “In 2017, I decided to do workshops… we mapped out the steps that it would take to bring our community from online to in-person through these workshops via the analytics and data that we were given not only through the group, but also our Squarespace website where we hosted all that additional information.” Currently, the website’s primary purpose is “as a place for donors and partners to be able to see our various programs, and give financial resources to keep those programs up and running.”&nbsp;</p><p class="">Build+Bloom also has a networking group called <a href="https://buildandbloom.org/sisterxsister"><span>SisterXSister</span></a>, which meets in eight cities across the United States on the third Saturday of the month. “The website now, I'm so thankful, serves as a place where all of the girls can come and register for their city, and where the ambassadors who lead each city have a password protected portal where they can login, see the lesson plan, design assets, and everything else they need to serve in their communities.”</p><p class="">Whitaker encourages anyone with an idea on the backburner to get started—whether it’s personal or professional. “A lot of us put off these incredible concepts that we have because we are too nervous to hit publish... With Squarespace, though, you can truly put your best foot forward... This all in one platform will prove to you that your ideas are worthy of going live, and give you the intuitive tools to do so.”</p><p class="">After creating a website, Whitaker recommends building out an email list. “You need to begin building your email list as soon as possible… For every total follower count or member count that you have, you want to have at least three-quarters of their email addresses. Even if you don’t start sending out regular emails or other campaigns until later on, start today, start now.”</p><p class="">To get Jessica Whitaker’s tricks for building an email list, watch the video above.</p><p class="">To learn more about Jessica’s work, visit <a href="http://www.jessicawhitaker.co/"><span>jessicawhitaker.com</span></a> and <a href="https://buildandbloom.org/"><span>buildandbloom.org</span></a>.</p><p class="">To launch your own idea with a website and email campaigns, visit <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/"><span>squarespace.com</span></a> to get started.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065/5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16/5e16454d23544b7b5ccb5663/1579649565638/1500w/Article_23_1138x1510.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1138" height="1510"><media:title type="plain">Jessica Whitaker: Build Your Community</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>2020 Design Trends </title><category>On Trend</category><dc:creator>Kristen O'Toole</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2020 17:58:27 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.squarespace.com/blog/2020-design-trends</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065:5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16:5e20a93797ced669656e6df2</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Whether or not you consider yourself a creative or visual person, web design shapes the world around you—and how you interact with it. Features, icons, and trends that might seem confusing or disruptive when you first encounter them become familiar and intuitive as they appear on more and more websites and digital experiences. When you’re new to creating a website, it can be easy to mimic what you’ve seen elsewhere—or to get ambitious and try to stand out with unconventional design choices that only end up confusing your site visitors. To deliver the best experience, find a balance for your site between digital design best practices and cutting-edge trends that will help you make the site your own and show off your unique aesthetic. Read on for three design trends to look for in 2020 from Squarespace’s in-house web designers.</p><h2>Unexpected Typography</h2><p class="">Type is a design element. Large, bold text can help emphasize the information or action you want your visitors to take on a webpage, but you don’t want them to feel like your site is yelling at them. When choosing a font, make sure the size and weight is clear and readable across your site when it comes to headlines, copy, and clickable buttons. Your font should be clear, but also eye-catching. After many years of simple, sans serif fonts dominating the web, 2020 may see serif fonts return to popularity, creating an elevated sense of sophistication.</p><p class="">Learn more about <a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206545327-Changing-fonts" target="_blank">using and changing fonts in Squarespace</a>.</p><h2>Recognizable Icons</h2><p class="">“Skeuomorphism” refers to a concept in design where digital elements resemble their real-world counterparts. For example, your mobile phone is most likely a flat, thin rectangle—but its interface probably contains “call” and “end call” buttons with icons that resemble the handset of an analog, corded phone. Web designers eschewed skeuomorphism for many years, but as our digital lives become more integrated with our experiences in the physical world, you can expect to see more 3D and lifelike web design in 2020.</p><h2>Even More Touchscreen Tools</h2><p class="">Have you ever found yourself instinctively poking at your laptop screen like it’s your phone? The slowly dissolving boundary between the physical and the digital shifts user expectations, and website navigation is being designed with tactile interfaces in mind. A mobile-first mindset is essential when building your website—especially if you want to make it easy for your customers to make purchases.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Learn how Squarespace helps your site function on mobile and touchscreen devices in our <a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205815398-How-will-my-site-appear-on-mobile-devices-" target="_blank">Help guide</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Need some help elevating your site design?

We sat down with her to learn more about how she discovered her passion for her craft while working in a completely different field.&nbsp;</p><h3>SQSP: How did you first get interested in photography?</h3><p class="">ES: I have always loved photography but fell in love with the fashion realm when I shot a friend of mine who had started modeling. The creativity was endless and I fell in love with capturing emotion. I grew up in a small town and had no idea what I was getting myself into or even where to begin in terms of the fashion industry. I did a lot of research and started experimenting with different techniques that have led me to where I am today.&nbsp;</p><h3>SQSP: How does your identity as a woman impact your work?</h3><p class="">ES: I believe women have a unique way of connecting with their subjects that can often be seen through their work. In my own work there is often a slight feminine, romantic element that is portrayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>SQSP: Has becoming a parent changed the way in which you approach your work?</h3><p class="">ES: Becoming a parent has helped me to focus immensely and has given me a new understanding of the value of time. Working as a freelancer has always been a balancing act so it is just about continuing to find that work/life balance.&nbsp;</p><h3>SQSP: What advice do you have for someone who is looking to get into photography?</h3><p class="">ES: Shoot what inspires you, it is true that if you love what you do it never feels like work. Your work should be authentic and truly represent who you are as a person. Try different techniques, shoot as often as you can to develop your craft and find your voice. When you are confident in your work everything else will follow.</p><h3>SQSP: What role does your website play in developing your business and brand?</h3><p class="">ES: In today’s digital age, a website plays a huge role in showcasing your work. It is a book in digital form and should represent who you are as a photographer. I am always driving social media avenues back to my website as it is crucial to clients and booking jobs.</p><h3>SQSP: What future project are you looking forward to creating?</h3><p class="">ES: I am looking forward to creating a book of <a href="http://www.emilysoto.com/polaroids" target="_blank">Polaroids</a>, I have so many that I haven’t released and others I am excited to create. I have so much film sitting waiting to be used and can’t wait for what is yet to come!&nbsp;</p><p class=""><br>To learn more about Emily’s work, visit her <a href="http://www.emilysoto.com/" target="_blank">website</a> or follow her on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/emilysoto/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.

Before he can begin to create, he must first establish a true connection with his subject. “While I'm drawing, I'm interviewing the sitter. All of that conversation works its way into the art,” says MacConnell. In his book, <a href="https://www.johnmacconnell.com/shop/draw-you-draw-me" target="_blank">Draw You / Draw Me</a>, he pays tribute to those he considers closest in his own personal community. “Community is the people you are surrounded by—people that share your ideals and way of life,” says MacConnell. He used this project to further support members of his community by donating a portion of the proceeds from the book to a nonprofit dedicated to suicide prevention in the LGBTQ community, in honor of two childhood friends he has lost.&nbsp;</p><h3>SQSP: How do you define ‘community’?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">JM: Community is the people you are surrounded by—people that share your ideals and way of life. My community is filled with artists and dreamers, doers and makers, teachers, thinkers, and healers. These people inspire and encourage me. My recent book, <em>Draw You / Draw Me</em> is a tribute to those that I consider the closest in my personal community. It is dedicated to two childhood friends that are no longer with us because they felt like outsiders in theirs. A portion of the proceeds from the book are being donated to The Trevor Project in their honor. The Trevor Project does great work to let young people know they're not alone.</p><h3>SQSP: What mental and/or physical space do you need when creating new work?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">JM: With my sketchbook, I can work anywhere. I love creating on location but I don't do it enough. In <em>Draw You / Draw Me</em> I made an effort to visit the subjects in their own homes to create their portraits. It adds to the work as the personal spaces provide context for the subjects and also helps them to relax in their own home.</p><p class="">When creating larger pieces, I need space. Living in New York City, can make that a problem. I work from home and have a small space in which I create. I'm constantly putting up and tearing down my easel when I have a subject over to pose. That said, I love working from my place. It's a much warmer environment than a traditional studio and it helps puts my subjects at ease.&nbsp;</p><h3>SQSP: Who in your community do you look to when you need support or inspiration for your work?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">JM: I surround myself with people that support and inspire me—artists, performers, athletes—anyone that sets goals and is taking steps to reach them. My mentor, the artist Mark Beard, is a huge inspiration. Every time I visit his studio he is working on something new. Additionally, I find support and inspiration on Instagram. Some artists are in NYC and we have met up, like Da Ping Lou, Adam Chuck, and Menelik Puryear. Others I've never met but watching them from afar inspires me to continue to push my practice, such as Jen Mann and Doron Langberg.</p><h3>SQSP: You’re currently based in New York City. Does living there influence the direction of your artwork?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">JM: I LOVE living in New York City. I truly thrive off the energy of my surroundings. It is incredibly inspiring to see so much going on, especially in the creative scene. From actors practicing their craft to designers launching their brands, it's motivating to be around others that are working to have their perspective seen. Additionally, living here offers me the opportunity to meet many people. Not only do I get to work with locals, but the many people visiting. I feel like one of the lucky few that get to meet the people I interact with on social media. Through my work I get to document these encounters. Part of my work is bringing the digital social space into the physical reality.</p><h3>SQSP: You’ve spent time teaching art as well. Did the experience of working with students change the way you felt about your own creative process? If so, how?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">JM: Teaching was definitely an eye-opening experience for me. I was teaching an introductory course, with no prerequisites. My struggle as a professor was reaching the students that took the class because they thought an art class would be an easy elective. Art is fun but requires dedicated work and a passion. It made me appreciate the students and anyone that makes a commitment to create.</p><h3>SQSP: Much of your current work focuses on the human male form. How does using a live model change the way you think about the art?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">JM: To do a thoughtful portrait, you need to spend time with the subject. I love meeting all the people I'm working with. While I'm drawing, I'm interviewing the sitter. I ask them where they're from, what they do, how their summer was... All of that conversation works its way into the art.</p><h3>SQSP: Your most recent book features some of your friends, colleagues, peers and mentors. How did your personal connection to the men featured in the book make you feel about the project?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">JM: This project is very important to me because of my connection with the men in it. All of them have impacted my work in one way or another. Some inspire me to create, some point me in the right direction when I'm lost, and others are simply my biggest cheerleaders that keep me motivated when the finish line is out of sight. Some of the people I had worked with in the past, but many were new. It was exciting for me to introduce so many of my friends to my world, a great experience to share with friends, and an honor to work with my mentors who I respect so much.&nbsp;</p><h3>SQSP: Can you tell us more about your regular drawing sessions? How has this experience positioned you as an expert on the figure in the local community?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">JM: I don't think I've made it to expert, yet, but I hope that my presence is inspiring to some to give drawing a try. These sessions are a really great place for people to get an introduction to figure drawing or get some practice in for the experienced. It's a very relaxed environment. We start with short poses that allow everyone to warm up and advance into longer poses as the session progresses. </p><h3>SQSP: What are you most excited to work on next?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">JM: I'm thinking it might be time for another show.

It’s time to embrace this next chapter and run with it.</em></p><blockquote><p class="">“For anyone who is trying to take their ideas or dreams to the next level or anyone entering some kind of transition period in your life, I want to be able to help you to enter that next chapter, and Squarespace allows you to do that.”</p></blockquote><p class="">Sorelle Amore is currently a successful photographer, filmmaker, influencer, and business woman who leverages inspiring messages about travel, photography, and improving one’s life to engage with her over 1.4 million followers on YouTube and Instagram.</p><p class="">But back in 2017, she was facing major personal and financial challenges. When she heard about ThirdHome’s “Best Job On the Planet” competition, she thought, “There was my ticket out of hell.” The job entailed traveling to 12 luxurious homes around the world while documenting the experience—and getting paid $10,000 per month. “The next step was to create a one-minute submission video… then just email it in, right? If I put my heart out and tell them… I’m perfect for it, it’ll work, correct?”</p><p class="">Fortunately, Amore was savvier than to believe her enthusiasm was enough to qualify her for the “best job on the planet.” “Anyone applying for a dream job or trying to get a client if you’re a freelancer, there are a lot of people applying for these jobs.” She knew that “simplicity and professionalism” were the keys to get her in the door, and that she needed to stand out from more than 17,000 other applicants. So she built a Squarespace site for her submission video—and included additional videos, photography, and other relevant work to demonstrate her expertise for the role.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Amore had been building websites for years before she created that submission site, and had switched to Squarespace for its ease of use as her personal platform developed. “You can update your website anytime to reflect brand new skills you’ve acquired or your new stage of life… It has to grow as you grow. Flexibility of life is key!”&nbsp;</p><p class="">To get a glimpse of where Sorelle Amore’s Squarespace site has taken her, and hear her recommendations on the basics of any good personal website, watch the video above.</p><p class="">To learn more about Sorelle’s work, visit <a href="https://www.sorelleamore.com/" target="_blank">sorelleamore.com</a> or check out her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/sorelleamore" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel.</p><p class="">To take your life to the next level with a personal website, visit <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">squarespace.com</a> to get started.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065/5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16/5e135040bca1015487f7e405/1579129746480/1500w/Article_08_1138x1510.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1138" height="1510"><media:title type="plain">Sorelle Amore: Stand Out With a Website</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Building Your Brand on Social Media</title><category>Know</category><dc:creator>Alyssa Wolff</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2020 15:53:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.squarespace.com/blog/building-your-brand-on-social-media</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065:5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16:5e14a8b10d946d7e1fa6019c</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">There are <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/social-media-marketing-statistics" target="_blank">3.2 billion social media users in the world</a>. That’s an incredibly large audience that presents amazing opportunities to connect. But when you’re launching a new social media presence for your brand, it can feel overwhelming.</p><p class="">Social media can be incredibly time consuming. There are a ton of different platforms and each one requires specific pieces of content—formatted in a certain way—in order to build a profile. Launching new social media accounts on <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.instagram.com" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, <a href="http://www.snapchat.com" target="_blank">SnapChat</a>, and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> may not all be necessary to get your brand off the ground. Instead, consider what your brand needs from social, and which platforms are home to the audience you want to reach, and then choose one or two platforms to start. For example, if you are selling beautiful, one-of-a-kind jewelry pieces, you may want to start with Instagram. Instagram allows its users to share highly visual content to their followers. But if you’re opening a new accounting firm and won’t have a ton of imagery, you may want to start out on LinkedIn instead. LinkedIn is a professional networking social media site that allows&nbsp; individuals and businesses to create profile pages that share job openings, business updates, contact information, and press mentions.</p><p class="">Once you’ve decided which platform or platforms to start with, it’s time to start planning out your content. In addition to creating a profile which will likely require a few photos, a bio, and a link to your <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/"><span>Squarespace</span></a> website, it’s smart to start thinking about how often you’d like to post new items on your account. Do you want to start with something new every other day? Or would you prefer a weekly posting cadence? Take a calendar and start writing out different ideas for the next 4–6 weeks. That way you can see how many ideas you have and how often you’d like to share with your audience. Keep in mind that you may not have too many followers at the beginning, so the first posts can be introductory in nature. For example, you may just want to post a few things about your business, new products your offering, or simply show off your latest press mention. Start to tell your story.</p><p class="">When creating your brand’s social media presence, it’s important to create posts that are authentic to who you are and what you want to present to the world. Make sure your style and tone match up with your professional persona. For example, if your brand doesn’t typically have a sense of humor, it does not have to be funny online. Take a peek at some of your competitors’ social media pages. Explore the different things they are sharing and the ways people are engaging with them. This can be helpful in figuring out what conversations are already happening in your space and how you can participate in them effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">Once you’ve established the platforms you’d like to be on and your social style, it’s time to start drafting and sharing social media posts. Build out a calendar and post according to your own timeline. Double check all of your posts for typos and remember to test out any links that you’re sharing with your followers. If you’re tagging someone in a post, it’s crucial that their name or handle is spelled correctly—otherwise the post will not actually tag them. Some brands use a custom link shortener like <a href="https://bitly.com/" target="_blank">bit.ly</a> or <a href="https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/190768?hl=en" target="_blank">Google</a> to keep track of how many people are clicking on the links that they share in posts. This will come in handy when analyzing the performance of your social media presence.&nbsp;</p><p class="">After your posts are live, people may begin to follow your account and engage with the content. Feel free to reply to fans or customers who are responding to your account. This will help build brand loyalty and adds an additional sense of authenticity to the account. If the comment is negative, you can choose not to respond, or simply ask them to send you a private message so you can help them in a less public forum.</p><p class="">Social media, as with any online brand building exercise, takes time to master. Take time to reflect on the posts you’ve shared and see how they have performed. Set goals for your accounts and see how you can change up your content to reach those milestones. There’s no such thing as a ‘perfect’ social media presence, so take measured risks and see how they perform for you. As you continue to build your social media accounts, you’ll be able to share your brand with an even broader audience which will ultimately help you grow your business.</p><p class="">If you need help <a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206543537" target="_blank">connecting your social accounts</a> to your Squarespace account, feel free to contact our <a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank">Customer Care Team</a>.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065/5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16/5e14a8b10d946d7e1fa6019c/1578601459554/1500w/Article_02_1138x1510.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1138" height="1510"><media:title type="plain">Building Your Brand on Social Media</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Reece Yeboah on Launching Saint London</title><category>Video</category><dc:creator>Kristen O'Toole</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 20:55:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.squarespace.com/blog/reece-yeboah-launching-saint-london</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065:5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16:5e0e1821eab4077726bdb4de</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">The website for contemporary fashion brand <a href="https://www.saint-london.com/" target="_blank">Saint London</a> reads: “SET A GOAL AND DON’T QUIT UNTIL YOU ATTAIN IT. WHEN YOU DO ATTAIN IT, SET ANOTHER GOAL, AND DON’T QUIT UNTIL YOU REACH IT. NEVER QUIT.” This is the ethos from which the label was born—Founder and Creative Director Reece Yeboah’s journey has been ‘a crazy one.’ After a couple of years studying fashion, he dropped out to self-fund his own label in 2013. Five years later at his first pop-up in Selfridges, the London department store bought the whole collection.</p><p class="">Last year, Saint London launched online for the first time, with a new collection of hoodies, t-shirts, and outerwear called Spiritual Awakening.&nbsp; According to the site, “each piece tells a story, and represents moments of enlightenment on Reece’s compelling journey.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">Major leaps forward don’t come without challenges, though. Yeboah began his business with the West London community where he grew up in mind. “If they wanted designs, bespoke stuff, they’d come to me.” Growing the Saint London brand means managing an online presence and driving more traffic to his digital platform. “It’s working right now,” he says, but branching out doesn’t mean he’s forgotten his roots. “Whether it’s just knowledge or business advice or just telling my whole story to the kids in the area… I’ll give back to the community in my work.”</p><p class="">Reece Yeboah participated in the 2019 <a href="https://frieze.com/conferences/art-fashion-summit-london" target="_blank">Art &amp; Fashion Summit in London</a> presented by Frieze Academy in partnership with Squarespace, where changemakers, polymaths, and visionaries explored what “making it” means to the brightest creatives in contemporary culture.</p><p class="">To learn more about Reece Yeboah’s work, visit <a href="https://www.saint-london.com/" target="_blank">saint-london.com</a> or follow Reece on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reisssaint/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.

It’s absolutely vital that you choose a strong password when setting up any new digital account, but it’s especially important when you’re creating a new website. This will be your business’s digital storefront&nbsp; so you’ll want to ensure you’re protecting your intellectual property, products, and online reputation.</p><p class="">In order to come up with a <a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001239268#toc-choose-a-strong-password" target="_blank">strong password</a>, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, don’t use the same password for multiple accounts. Your website should have its own secure password. Make sure you don’t use your birthday, your address, your name, or the word ‘password’ for your password. The same goes for your pets’ names or your anniversary, and any other personal information that you would feel comfortable sharing with a casual acquaintance.&nbsp;</p><p class="">For an added layer of security (and peace of mind!) to protect your Squarespace website, you may want to consider using <a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001239268#toc-add-extra-protection-with-two-factor-authentication" target="_blank">two-factor authentication</a>. We recommend using the Google Authenticator App (available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605" target="_blank">iOS</a>) when setting up your two-factor authentication system. This app will generate a <a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000044827" target="_blank">unique code</a> for you every time you log into your Squarespace account. Once you type in your authentication code, you’ll gain access to your account.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Make sure you change your passwords periodically for both your Squarespace account and other online accounts to keep your information safe and protected.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065/5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16/5e1616b37582c361dd74e6d9/1578525697072/1500w/Article_01_1138x1510.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1138" height="1510"><media:title type="plain">Stay Secure: Password Best Practices</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Stories of the Entrepreneurial Spirit</title><category>On Trend</category><dc:creator>Alyssa Wolff</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 19:37:23 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.squarespace.com/blog/stories-of-the-entrepreneurial-spirit</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065:5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16:5e162b152f6dba694677ab73</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Squarespace and <a href="https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/" target="_blank">WePresent</a> recently teamed up to produce a docu-series entitled, “<a href="https://makeitreal.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Make It Real.</a>” This video series features four Black woman-identifying Squarespace customers including Liv Little, Holley Kholi-Murchison, Jade Purple Brown, and Sharmadean Reid.

The world is still being introduced to drag and it's not going anywhere in a hurry.</p><h3>SQSP: Unsurprisingly, you maintain a fabulous digital presence. How important has it been for you to build this up and maintain it?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">CH: My entire life I have been raised around technology and been around social media from a young age. social media is a great outlet to put your craft out to the world and to reach people of all ages and identities that wouldn't necessarily be able to reach you physically. I love having that connection with the people that want to reach me but I'm also very good and being able to put my phone down and live in the moment.&nbsp;</p><h3>SQSP: Where do you see yourself in 2020?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">CH: Next year my one goal is to work as hard as possible and to perform the best i can and meet as people as possible that have made this year so incredible, i would have these opportunities if it wasn't for RuPauls Drag Race but more so the fans so for that I am forever in debt to them.</p><p class="">To learn more about what’s next for Cheryl, visit her <a href="https://www.cherylholequeen.com/" target="_blank">website</a> or follow her on <a href="https://twitter.com/CherylHoleQueen" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

Kicking us off is singer/songwriter/actress <a href="https://www.sharonvanetten.com/" target="_blank">Sharon Van Etten</a>, whose fifth studio album—released last January—ended up on several “Best Of 2019” lists.</p><h3>SQSP: <em>Remind Me Tomorrow</em> came out at the very start of the year. How fantastic has it been to track fan reactions to the new music throughout the rest of 2019?</h3><p class="">SVE: I feel very lucky to have been able to tour the US, Canada, UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand this past year.&nbsp; I know this album marks a major sonic shift, but I needed a change for myself and I hoped that my fans would be right there with me.</p><h3>SQSP: <em>The OA</em> is one of the most incredible, memorable, unique shows in recent memory, and you were wonderful in it. How do you feel to have played such an interesting, major character in the series?</h3><p class="">SVE: On some level, I related to the character Rachel very much.&nbsp; I grew up in choir, left home to pursue music, and something horrific happened to me that changed my life.&nbsp; Granted, I wasn't abducted by a scientist who conducted experiments on people that have had near death experiences, but it helped me to externalize emotions that I have held inside that aren't easy to communicate with words.&nbsp; I still have a lot to learn about the acting world. but that was an incredible introduction.</p><h3>SQSP: Can you speak to how pursuing other passions has affected your music?</h3><p class="">SVE: My life has grown so much since I took the time to focus on my love and home, rather than tour nonstop.&nbsp; My songs are informed by my personal experience and how I relate to others.  Without connection to the outside world, I would have written the same album over and over.&nbsp; Now with a partner, who supports my every endeavor, and a son, who teaches me how unconditional love can be, I have a deeper sense of purpose and priority.&nbsp;</p><h3>SQSP: After a very busy, fulfilling 2019, what lies ahead in 2020?</h3><p class="">SVE: I moved to LA at the end of the year and I will be settling in, getting my studio together to make more music, doing some tour dates, then heading back to school. But taking it slow, while doing all those things...</p><p class=""><em>To learn more about what Sharon Van Etten has planned for 2020, visit her </em><a href="https://www.sharonvanetten.com/" target="_blank"><em>website</em></a><em>.

his outdoor adventure videography business.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class=""><em>Maybe you’re about to start your first job or you’d like to finally launch that side hustle you’ve been thinking about. With this series, our Squarespace YouTube creators share their own stories and tell you how to get started. It’s time to embrace this next chapter and run with it.</em></p><p class="">Levi Allen thought that making outdoor adventure videos—and getting paid for it—was too good to be true. He got a few jobs making wedding videos that helped him learn his craft before he leaned into one of his passions as a filmmaking subject: biking. He created some videos about biking and built a site to host them. “I just thought I thought that's what I was supposed to do,” says Allen. “What I learned later is when you make a website for your videos or for your work or whatever thing you're trying to do next... you're kind of putting a signpost in the ground and saying to other people, ‘Hey, I'm open for business! This is the thing that I'm legitimately doing...it's not just an idea, it's not just a nice thought, I've got a webpage. That to me felt very official when I was starting out.”</p><p class="">It also led directly to his first gig: while a cousin recommended Allen to an acquaintance in need of abn adventurous filmmaker, that acquaintance found his website and sent him an email. “I was like, how did this happen? Next thing you know, I was on a boat to film some mountain biking… that was the first time I ever got paid to do anything outdoor-related.” Now, with Squarespace, he runs an online store and is able to create password-protected hidden pages to deliver proposals directly to clients. “It feels really custom...don't underestimate the role that a website could play and getting you to where you want to go.”</p><p class="">For Allen, a sense of purpose is essential for any business’s digital experience: “it's one thing to just open up the social media account on whatever platform is popping off, but I think it's really powerful to do that extra work and have a website that’s specifically about what you want to make and who you want to make it for or what type of person you are and what type of opportunities you're looking for and what types of companies you want to be partnered with.”</p><p class="">“We can get a little caught up in just waiting for someone to give us permission,” says Allen. “That permission might never have come if I didn’t take ownership over saying, this is who I want to be, this is the kind of work that I want to do. Put that out there, boldly state it and see what happens.”</p><p class="">To see the beautiful British Columbia landscape where Allen works and hear his key tips for launching your own site, watch the video above.</p><p class="">To learn more about Levi’s work, visit <a href="https://www.leftcoast.co/" target="_blank">leftcoast.co</a> or check out his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJXz-QU2_KU7pSuWr12XTHA" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class="">To launch your own new adventure, visit <a href="http://squarespace.com/">squarespace.com</a> to get started.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065/5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16/5e134ea3a7f8cc3fa5c847c8/1579824137195/1500w/Article_08_1138x1510.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1138" height="1510"><media:title type="plain">Levi Allen on Not Waiting for Permission</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Your First Email Campaign</title><category>Know</category><dc:creator>Alyssa Wolff</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 21:17:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.squarespace.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-first-email-campaign</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065:5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16:5dfd39f1ca81654e7f612380</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Looking for a new way to connect with your customers? Try sending a marketing email. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/why-marketers-should-keep-sending-you-emails"><span>Email is 40 times more effective</span></a> for acquiring customers than Facebook or Twitter. Squarespace’s <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/email-marketing"><span>Email Campaigns</span></a> makes it easy for you to create, design, and send best-in-class content to your entire mailing list. If you haven’t tried out this new tool, here’s how you can get started today:</p><h3>Step 1: Determine what kind of email you want to send</h3><p class="">First, simply decide what you’d like to say. Perhaps you want to promote a sale or send a ‘thank you’ note to your most loyal customers. Or you just wrote a new blog post and would like to share it with your mailing list. Or you’re hosting an event next week and want people to have a chance to RSVP. With Squarespace’s all-in-one platform, you can build emails that are visually consistent with your website so your customers will recognize who the email is from right away. Simply click “Create” then choose whether you’d like to send a “<a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001359947-Sending-email-campaigns">blast email</a>,” which are individual campaigns that you can send to a mailing list or an “<a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002077567">automated email</a>,” which are email campaigns you can set up to send after a person performs a specific action on your website. Then browse the layouts within Email Campaigns on your dashboard to see which one best suits your message. You can also build your own layout by choosing ‘Start Blank.’ </p><h3>Step 2: Start creating your first email</h3><p class="">Once you’ve found the layout that works best for you, it’s time to start adding your content. You can repurpose existing images and descriptions from your website,&nbsp; or you can start fresh. Add in some new photos from your latest product line or share a party picture from last year’s birthday bash. Then write some copy to make sure your message stands out. Spend some time thinking about your subject line, too. Creative, intriguing, or funny subject lines will stand out in crowded inboxes and inspire your recipients to open&nbsp; your email.</p><h3>Step 3: Choose your audience</h3><p class="">You can add subscribers manually, import a mailing list from another service, or add a subscription form to your website so fans of your brand can sign up for your list. Make sure you’ve set up your Sender Profile (and verified your domain) so none of your beautiful emails end up stuck in a spam filter.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 4: Use Squarespace Analytics to track your success</h3><p class="">Once you’ve sent your first marketing email, you’ll be able to track your success using the Email Campaigns Dashboard. If you are on a <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/pricing"><span>Basic or Advanced Commerce plan</span></a>, you can also see the sales resulting from the email campaign in the Traffic Sources panel in Analytics.&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 5: Start planning your next email campaign</h3><p class="">Now that you’re an email marketing pro, it’s time to start getting ready for your next campaign. You already know how beautiful, seamless, and impactful email marketing can be. Don’t lose your momentum—choose your plan today. For as little as<a href="https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002123507#toc-plans-and-pricing" target="_blank"> $7/month,</a> you can continue standing out in any inbox. We retained all of your mailing lists and drafts so you can keep sending beautiful emails to your audience, whether you’re sharing a blog post, sending an event invitation, or announcing a sale on your products or services—choose the plan that’s right for you.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065/5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16/5dfd39f1ca81654e7f612380/1579824065464/1500w/Article_03_1138x1510.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1138" height="1510"><media:title type="plain">Your First Email Campaign</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Dream It, Build It, Make It: Pip Cowley</title><category>Makers</category><dc:creator>David Replogle</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 19:01:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.squarespace.com/blog/dream-it-pip-cowley</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5134cbefe4b0c6fb04df8065:5dcb2d0669b294381f8ffb16:5e13aeb1f8a9c06668e34154</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">“Dream it, Build it, Make it” is a three-part Instagram docu-series that follows photographer <a href="http://www.pipcowleyshoots.com/" target="_blank">Pip Cowley</a> as she turns her vision for capturing dance on the streets of New York City into a reality.

It takes a long time and a lot of hard work; it’s not a quick outcome, you don’t suddenly just arrive at that. The process is way more enjoyable because you might sometimes not even like some of the things you’ve made but to get there was so fun, or you learned so much.”&nbsp;</p><p class="">The value of making something without focusing on the end result has underpinned Bovan’s career, beginning with his formal education. “It was really creative studying at Saint Martins, it really helps you shape your own identity and your own vision… They want you to just be very much your own person and your own self and that takes quite a long time to actually realize.” Operating from a strong sense of self and grounded viewpoint allows Bovan to take the creative risks he sees as necessary to succeed. “You want to challenge your own ideas of taste, of fashion, of creativity. It’s difficult to get perspective and see yourself from the outside. So each season I have to challenge everything.”&nbsp;</p><p class="">Bovan’s website is “an incredibly important tool” because 20 years ago, designers didn’t have the ability to display their complete back catalogues in one place. Consumers, critics, and fans would have had to hunt down coverage in publications or fashion shows on VHS. “I like to have the record of the work, because if people are interested in the brand, they engage with the website and then they see the progression. Each season is a very different character for me.” The site also gives him flexibility to show off his work in different media and formats, like his independent ‘zines and catwalk videos. “Designers in 2019 are much more like polymaths doing a lot of different things, so it’s incredibly important for people to see it all in one place. With Instagram, it’s more of a zeitgeist, it’s more of a moment, it’s more “now”, so you have to scroll through quite a long way and even then it’s hard to understand whether what you’re looking at is a project. People’s attention spans have also gone, so they’re not necessarily engaging.”&nbsp;</p><p class="">Bovan’s attention moves quickly, too: “Your latest collection is always the most exciting thing you’re doing, your latest piece of work is always the most compelling, like: this is it!” He still values the early creative process for each collection: “It’s the most fun bit and you never know where it’s going to go, this could just be terrible, this could be amazing. It should be on the knife edge in between. A lot of things don’t work, and you maybe get them out next year, or the year after. It’s all learning and it’s all building up.”</p><p class="">Matty Bovan participated in the 2019 <a href="https://frieze.com/conferences/art-fashion-summit-london" target="_blank">Art &amp; Fashion Summit in London</a> presented by Frieze Academy in partnership with Squarespace, where changemakers, polymaths, and visionaries explored what “making it” means to the brightest creatives in contemporary culture.</p><p class=""><em>To learn more about Matty Bovan’s work, visit </em><a href="https://www.mattybovan.com/" target="_blank"><em>mattybovan.com</em></a><em> or follow him on </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/babbym/" target="_blank"><em>Instagram</em></a><em>.

Food writer <a href="https://www.priyakrishna.me/" target="_blank">Priya Krishna</a> published her debut cookbook<em> Indian-ish: Recipes and Antics From a Modern American Family</em> last spring.</p><p class=""><em>Photo credit: Mackenzie Kelley</em></p><h3>SQSP: Your first cookbook, <em>Indian-ish, </em>was released this spring. What has the reception been like from family, friends, the press?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">PK: Ha, my family members are still awestruck when they see people making their dishes on Instagram. It's been awesome. Food media, and the cookbook industry in general, remains predominantly white—and so does the home cooking featured within them. I wanted to show people that Indian food is everyday, accessible food. And it's been exciting to see the book resonate with so many people, both Indian and non-Indian.</p><h3>SQSP: You have an amazing digital presence—how important has it been to cultivate and maintain this over the years?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">PK: Part of me wishes Instagram didn't exist, because it can definitely be bad for my sanity. But it's also really fun just to showcase what you're making in your kitchen, or eating (I like to document my partner Seth's baking adventures, and that has been a source of genuine enjoyment and fun for me). It's also a great platform for highlighting other POC businesses and authors.</p><h3>SQSP: What are some changes you’ve witnessed in the food industry recently, and what additional changes do you see coming down the pipeline in the (near) future?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">PK: Not to be a broken record, but I want the industry to be less white. I want to see the industry giving resources, book deals, and big-ticket stories to more people of color. I want non-European cuisines to be normalized within the sphere of home cooking. I want to see more diverse staffs at food magazines and restaurants. I want to see more POC with decision making power.</p><h3>SQSP: Where do you see yourself in 2020?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">PK: Happy and healthy and surrounded by my family, I hope!!!!</p><p class="">To learn more about what’s ahead for Priya, visit her <a href="https://www.priyakrishna.me/" target="_blank">website</a>.

We chatted with her about how engaging with her online community is vital inspiration for her darkly humorous illustrations and comics.<br></p><h3>SQSP: When did you first decide you wanted to become an artist?</h3><p class="">SR: Being an artist was my ‘dream job’ since I was a child, but I didn’t attempt to pursue it professionally until my late 20s.</p><h3>SQSP: How does your identity as a woman impact your work?</h3><p class="">SR: Enormously—especially in my comics where my own experiences are often (though not always!) the inspiration behind many of situations my female characters find themselves in.</p><h3>SQSP: How much of your personal style or personality gets reflected in your professional brand?</h3><p class="">SR: So much of it! I have a pretty dry and sometimes dark sense of humor, which I think is often communicated in my output. I also dress the women I draw in outfits I wish I owned or were wearing that day.</p><h3>SQSP: Where do you find inspiration for your artwork?</h3><p class="">SR: Lately, my artwork has been strongly impacted by my followers, and their submissions to an Insta-story series I started called “Screenshots with Psychopaths and Other Stories.” It is inspiring to hear women share their stories. I’m also a huge fan of graphic novels, especially those created by women. There’s usually a giant stack of them on my nightstand—reading a great graphic novel fires up my own urge to create. Same goes for thought-provoking books and television. I’m currently working my way through Roxane Gay’s body of work, and re-watching “The Sopranos.”</p><h3>SQSP: What future project are you most excited to work on next?</h3><p class="">SR: I’m pretty excited about, and currently spending most of my free time writing and sketching an outline for a graphic novel about dating in New York City.</p><h3>SQSP: How does your community influence your work?</h3><p class="">SR: Lately, community has been at the core of my work. “Screenshots with Psychopaths and Other Stories”<em> </em>wouldn’t be possible without the Violet Clair community, who have even taken to calling themselves ‘Clair Bears.’ Their submissions, stories, and the discussion that unfolds in the comments are hugely influential to me.</p><h3>SQSP: What role does your website play in building your brand and your business?</h3><p class="">SR: It plays a huge role! As much as I love social media, I really see my website as my homebase. It’s where I can showcase the breadth of my work, sell products, share original content, and allow visitors to learn a bit more about my story.</p><h3>SQSP: What advice do you have for artists looking to go into business for themselves?</h3><p class="">SR: Getting started is the hardest part. You need to get really comfortable with accepting (and even embracing) rejection. When I first started, I reached out to as many people as I possibly could, and at times it felt like I was shouting into a void. It’s important to keep going and believe in what you do with an enthusiasm that borders on delusional.</p><p class="">To learn more about Samantha’s work, visit her <a href="https://www.violetclair.com/" target="_blank">website</a> or follow her on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/violetclair/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.
